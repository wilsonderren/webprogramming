# Web programming style guide

Use this CSS file as the starting point for your work. You can simply do something like this in your html:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://55060509.webdevmmu.uk/style-guide/global.css">`

That means you will always be using the latest version of the global.css file.

You can also download the global.css file (or even clone this repo) and use it as a base.
